"""Dummy file to avoid `ty` failure.

`ty` fails if called only on files without the `.py` extension.
(And, it doesn't do anything with them even if they are explicitly passed on the command line!)
This file exists to avoid that error, since (at the time of writing)
all other Python files in the directory lack the `.py` extension.
